Humanities subject consists of Language, History, Music, History and etc. All these subjects consists of more theories related to them. Most of the course videos I took to find the mostly used videos styles consisted of person talking or lecturing , two or more people having conversations and presenting some kind of a text in the screen. Sometimes there were combinations of all these in some videos.

So I chose Person, Conversation and Text as my video prediction styles in the video classification part for my research part. Some courses are presented in the form of a documentary style but since my time was limited and there was no clear way to predict a video is a documentary or not I had to drop that type of classification for my research part.
