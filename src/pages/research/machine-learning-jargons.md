For a person who is new to _Machine Learning_ and _AI_ as a whole can be a
daunting experience since there are numerous terminologies around the field.
Let's break those words into meaningful sentences so a normal person can understand
what they are

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Jargon</th><th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Activation Function</td>
        <td>
            A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid) that takes in the weighted sum of all of the inputs from the previous layer and then generates and passes an output value (typically nonlinear) to the next layer.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
